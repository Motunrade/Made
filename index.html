<h1 align="center">Welcome to Made International Schools.</h1>
<p>In the city and surrounding neighborhoods of Lagos, Nigeria, there are very few quality options for secondary education, locally know as Junior Secondary School (JSS) 1-3 and Senior Secondary School (SSS) 1-3.

This results in the families of Lagos having to send their young children to schools hundreds, if not thousands, of miles away to receive quality education.
Navigating unfamiliar environments has always been a key part of a education, whether the challenge is physical, important or leadership.</p>

<h3>As children move through Nursery School to Primary, the emphasis is on building a foundation for lifelong learning and community service. Expectations for academic achievement are set high, yet balanced with a rich curriculum of competitive and recreational athletics, music and drama, visual arts and exciting excursions. They continue to gain confidence and build the resilience and strength of character that they need to take smart risks, use their voice and develop to their full potential.
